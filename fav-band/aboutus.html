          <h2>ZAC BROWN</h2>
          <p>Zac Brown is the founder, front man, and lead vocalist for the multi-platinum, Grammy Award-winning, southern rock group Zac Brown Band. In addition to being the founding member of Zac Brown Band and leading it through its overwhelming success, Brown is also credited as an impactful songwriter, producer, record label head, business man, and philanthropist – making him one of the sharpest minds among today’s generation of artists focused on shifting the paradigm of the music business.

            Brown was born in 1978 in Atlanta, Georgia and grew up in a family of 12 children. Later on, Brown attended the University of West Georgia and in 2002, founded Zac Brown Band. Since then, Brown’s passion shifted to music and he went on to start his own label, Southern Ground Artists, in 2003. From there, Brown’s first widely distributed studio album with Zac Brown Band, The Foundation, sold more than 5 million copies making the album 5x platinum following its release in 2008. The lead song off The Foundation, “Chicken Fried,” the band’s first national release, also went 5x platinum with over 5 million sales and over 255 million streams. Brown has released four studio albums, two live albums, a greatest hits album, and an extended play produced by Dave Grohl, all with Zac Brown Band - now completely made up with Brown along with Jimmy De Martini, John Driskell Hopkins, Clay Cook, Chris Fryar, Coy Bowles, Daniel de los Reyes, and Matt Mangano.
            
            Zac Brown Band’s success can largely be attributed to Brown’s interest in pushing creative boundaries through collaborations with top artists across genres including Avicii, Chris Cornell, Jimmy Buffett, Foo Fighters, Sheryl Crow, Sara Bareilles, and Jason Mraz to name a few. Most recently, Brown worked with Shawn Mendes on writing his latest single with Zac Brown Band titled “Someone I Used To Know,” which debuted on Billboard’s Hot Country Song Chart the week of its release in Nov. 2018. The new material helped the band kick off its spring “Down The Rabbit Hole Live Tour” which toured through April 2019, and followed 2018’s 31-stop summer tour of the same name. “SIUTK” also marks a new era for Zac Brown Band, including the bands current summer tour, “The Owl Tour,” in support of the upcoming new album.
            
            In December of 2018, Brown announced the launch of his new entertainment and lifestyle branded parent company, Zac Brown Collective, formerly known as Southern Ground. The reimagined company expanded its brand portfolio; further rising Brown’s artistic and entrepreneurial pursuits to new heights. Zac Brown Collective brings together the best in music, film, food, fashion, custom design, and American-made gear to form a company made up of brands that are fully grounded in the “American experience.”
            
            Brown’s commitment to giving back has also been at the forefront of his career since day one when he founded Camp Southern Ground. The camp, Brown’s biggest passion, is an inclusive camp serving children ages 7-17 with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), ADHD, dyslexia, social or emotional challenges, and typically developing children. The camp’s off-season programming supports post 9/11 veterans in their readjustment to civilian life. Zac Brown Collective allocates funds and resources to the camp – making all of Brown’s work beneficial to a cause dear to his heart. In 2017, Brown was honored with the CRS Humanitarian Award, presented annually to musicians who use their careers to serve others in need and contribute to the greater good. The award was presented to Brown for his work supporting our nation's veterans and for his nonprofit passion project Camp Southern Ground.

          <h2>COY BOWLES</h2>
          <p>When I was a kid, I had a room that was next to my bedroom at my parent’s house. Actually, it was part of the attic. It was my world and secret passageway into music and all things creative and awesome. The walls were filled with photos of my favorite bands, musicians, and skateboarders that had been ripped out of magazines and stuck to the wall with thumbtacks and Scotch tape. There was a hammock in this musical, isolation chamber that was filled with sleeping bags and old pillows. I would sit in the hammock and listen to music everyday. I would sing as loud as I could and fill my body with music. It gave me the feeling that I was connected with a force that drives all things amazing. I would picture myself on stages playing for people that were there for only one reason - to get away from life and become part of this connection with all things amazing. I dreamed of being in a band with other musicians that were so in tune with each other that when united we could soar to musical places that no other combination of people could reach. We would sing and play songs about life, struggles, and love. This imaginary stage, fans, and band were and have always been all I ever wanted. About five years ago, I opened my eyes and looked out at a sea of people who were connecting to the music playing. I looked up from my guitar and saw a stage full of my best friends, who are the most incredible musicians I know. I was living my dream. I am still living my dream. I am Coy Bowles and I play guitar, organ, and write songs in the Zac Brown Band.
            
            I started playing guitar at age 11. By the time I was 13, I had a band called Betty Doom. We played punk rock and rock-n-roll music at churches and at friend’s birthday parties in my hometown, Thomaston, Georgia. It still seems ironic that we played punk rock in church. We had rehearsal at my house so all the instruments stayed set up in my bedroom. I taught myself how to play bass, drums, and write songs. Something always happened when a guitar was in my hand. I would start playing for what I thought was 30 minutes, but when my parents hollered up the stairs for dinner, hours would have flown by like some sort of time abyss. I was addicted to the feeling of being in on the know. By that I mean I was and have always been totally consumed with feeling like I am connected to this crazy energy by being able to play the guitar lick or sing the song that makes me feel like I’m alive.
            
            I went to college for biology at West GA College where I met Zac. I later shifted gears right before graduating and decided that, do or die, I was a musician and that was all that mattered to me. During this period, I started tinkering with the piano as a different method for writing songs. I took a year off and practiced eight hours a day in order to get into Georgia State University’s Jazz Studies program. I played guitar everyday, all day, for four years while in college, totally consumed with the music of Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and many others. I graduated and started my own band, Coy Bowles and The Fellowship. We opened for Zac Brown Band at the Sky Bar in Auburn, Alabama, and a week or two later, I got a call from Zac saying, “I like what you are doing with music. If you want to open for us full-time, the spot is there. Or if you want to leave your keys on stage and play keys with us on the next few shows then come on.” Years later, here I am! Still sitting in and loving every minute of it.
            
            Oh yeah, I have also written four children’s book called Amy Giggles - Laugh Out Loud, Will Powers - Where There's a Will There's a Way, When You're Feeling Sick and Behind the Little Red Door. </p>

          <h2>CLAY COOK</h2>
          <p>Hello, Internet. This is awkward so I'll make it quick.

            I was born on April 20th, 1978 (send cash, not presents) in Atlanta, GA. Had a relatively simple, suburban upbringing. My interest in music was a little out of the ordinary for most 5 year olds. I was actually PLAYING guitar by 7. While everyone else was playing video games, I was practicing scale fingers & chord changes. I am still good at Tecmo Bowl though.
            
            Fast forward 10 years. They don't let you take 'guitar' in public school. Soooo, I gave up on being a 5'8" white boy in the NBA. I picked up drums in the fine arts department in high school. By the time I was auditioning for Berklee College of Music, I changed my principal instrument BACK to guitar.
            
            Berklee was great. You get out of it what you put into it. I met some life long friends there as well. I spent two years there & decided to leave school with my then current bandmate, John Mayer. John & I moved from Boston to Atlanta & started writing songs together. That faded away & I joined my Uncle's band: The Marshall Tucker Band. I learned SO much while touring with them.
            
            I left that group to play bass in the first line up of Sugarland (a line up that looks almost nothing like today's duo). During this time I also started producing & engineering records in the Atlanta area. Throw a nice long run with Shawn Mullins in the mix & fast forward to late 2008: I join Zac Brown Band full time. ZBB allows me to stretch out on a bunch of different instruments. It's funny, but I feel that my whole life has been preparing me to be in this band.
            
            Anyway, I REALLY enjoy being in ZBB. Not sure how life could get much better... but nothing will surprise me at this point - well, maybe if Zac's head opened up & an alien popped out... actually, never mind. That wouldn't surprise me.</p>
